# ERC-Path-Planning
[Replit project](https://replit.com/@RhythmBansal1/ERC#main.py)
## Description
You will be given a set of obstacles and one source point and a destination point. All
coordinates will be given. You need to find a path from the source to the destination
using ***RRT***. The path should not intersect any obstacles and should be a perfectly valid
path. You will also be given a bounding box in which you are allowed to sample the
points for making the tree.


The bounding box is the square with corners at `(0, 0), (0, 100), (100, 100), (100, 0)`.
The obstacle list, start point and goal point are as follows.

```python
obstacle_list = [
  [(40, 0), (40, 40), (50, 50), (60, 40), (50, 40)],
  [(10, 10), (20, 20), (10, 30), (0, 20)],
  [(50, 60), (70, 80), (60, 100), (40, 80), (45, 100)],
  [(70, 20), (90, 20), (80, 40)]
]

start = (1, 1)
goal = (100, 1)

path = RRT(start,goal, obstacle_list)

visualize(path, obstacle_list)
```
